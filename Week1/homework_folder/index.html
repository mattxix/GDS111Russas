        <p>Welcome to my page about me! I'll go over some of my interest and different hobbies.</p>

        <h2>Video Editing!</h2>
        <p>Since 8th grade, I have taught myself how to use Adobe After Effects to create videos for my YouTube and TikTok.</p>
        <p>It's been over a year since I stopped editing as much as I used to, which I will mention in the next section.</p>

        <h2>My Transition Into 3D Graphics</h2>
        <p>After so many years of editing videos, I learned that my favorite part of it was the video itself. I started to pay close attention to different 3D artists and film makers, which turned into a love for creating the videos rather than editing them. The two different paths I want to bring my studies of 3D go from character creation and animation. </p>
        <p>Below are some of my works as a beginner in 3D art.</p>
